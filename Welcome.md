Hello! Here, you will find some starter projects that I have created. I have collected the vast majority of these datasets off of Kaggle and other sites within the Public Domain. Addiionally, I extracted, analyzed, and visualized data in each dataset using a variation of Tableau, SQL, Python and Excel. After executing those steps, I then present my findings and analysis in the form of a brief Powerpoint Presentation. I am always eager to learn and grow. I am always looking for ways to get better and fine-tune my skillset Thanks for viewing!
